## Messaging Principles

1. **Lead with value** - $10K+/year enterprise tool, now free and extensible
2. **Emphasize speed** - "an afternoon with Claude" not "15-30 hours"
3. **OpenClaw native** - these are LLM-assisted builders, time estimates should reflect that
4. **Revenue share is real** - 50% split, contribute to consume model
5. **First-mover advantage** - early domains own their verticals

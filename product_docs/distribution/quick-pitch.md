## The 30-Second Version

MoltPulse is open-source industry intelligence - aggregates stock data, news, RSS, social into automated reports. Like AlphaSense ($10K+/yr) but free and self-hosted.

**What you'd build**: YAML config + optional Python (afternoon with Claude)

**What you'd get**: Free access to all network content + revenue share + own your vertical

## Objection Handlers (Quick)

**"What's the catch?"**
> You're betting time on network success. But you get a useful intelligence tool either way.

**"How long does it actually take?"**
> You've seen what this community ships - Moltbook went viral in a week. A domain is simpler - mostly YAML config, afternoon with Claude.

**"How much could I actually earn?"**
> At Year 1 scale (500 subscribers): top 10% earn ~$180/month. At scale (10K subs): ~$3,600/month. Early publishers get tenure bonus.

**"What if someone else builds my industry first?"**
> Multiple publishers per domain is fine. Different perspectives, different audiences. Competition improves quality.

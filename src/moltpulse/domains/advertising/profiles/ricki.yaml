    # Theme identification prompt (customizes the default)
    theme_identification: |
      You are analyzing advertising industry intelligence for nonprofit fundraising.

      Review the data and identify exactly 3 themes most relevant for donor outreach:
      - Industry financial health (giving capacity signals)
      - Leadership transitions (relationship opportunities)
      - Market sentiment and trends (messaging implications)

      Each theme should combine evidence from multiple sources (news, social, financial)
      and have a clear implication for donor cultivation timing or messaging.

      Respond with JSON only (no markdown code fences):
      {
        "themes": [
          {
            "title": "Theme title (5-7 words)",
            "summary": "One sentence explaining the theme",
            "relevant_citations": [1, 3, 5],
            "implication": "One sentence on what this means for fundraising"
          }
        ]
      }

    # Narrative style prompt (customizes the generation)
    narrative_style: |
      Write an executive intelligence brief for a nonprofit development officer
      targeting advertising industry donors.

      Structure using the Pyramid Principle:
      1. Lead with the bottom line - what should they do this week?
      2. Support with 3 themes explaining why
      3. Each theme backed by evidence with inline [N] citations
      4. End with specific, timed action items

      For each theme section, include a "Fundraising angle:" that explains:
      - Outreach timing implications
      - Messaging considerations
      - Relationship opportunities

      Write in prose, not bullet lists (except for action items).
      Keep each theme section to 2-3 sentences.
      Make recommended actions specific with timing (e.g., "This week:", "Q1:").

    # System context for all LLM calls (legacy, used if narrative_mode: false)
    system_context: |

    # Executive summary prompt (legacy)
    executive_summary: |
      Provide a 2-3 sentence executive summary highlighting the single most
      important development and its implications for nonprofit fundraising
      targeting advertising industry donors.

    # Strategic recommendations prompt (legacy)
    recommendations: |
      Provide 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations for a nonprofit fundraiser
      targeting advertising industry donors. Consider:
      - Timing of outreach based on industry cycles
      - Companies showing strong financial performance or CSR initiatives
      - Executive moves that create relationship opportunities
      - M&A activity implications for donor landscape

    # Per-section insight prompts (legacy)
    section_insights:
      financial: |
        Analyze the stock performance data. Focus on industry health signals
        and implications for corporate giving capacity. Identify companies
        with strong performance that may have increased philanthropic budgets.

      news: |
        Identify top 3 strategic themes and connect them to partnership
        opportunities for nonprofit organizations. Note any CSR, DEI, or
        sustainability initiatives mentioned.

      pe_activity: |
        Summarize M&A implications for the donor landscape. Highlight
        post-merger integration opportunities where outreach timing matters.
